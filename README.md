Issues and Customer Requests
============================

This is a special project to capture customer reported bugs, feature requests, etc, across all Iron.io services. Simply create a new issue and then "Watch" it to follow the progress.

To follow the progress of a request, simply "Watch" it. The more watchers, the more popular a feature will be considered.
